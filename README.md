# Olympic-history-dataset-analysis-
The report study and analysis the Olympic history dataset which contain information about the athletes and results for 120 years from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
Statistical analysis was performed to study the dataset in general and two machine learning analysis were implemented. The first one was to predict the suitable sport to an athlete based on physical features which are age, height and weight. Decision tree algorithm was implemented on 40 different sports and the accuracy result of the model’s performance was low so that we applied the algorithm with 5 sports which are required unusual height or weight. The technique able to predict the sport for the player with accuracy 70%.
The second technique was to find out how the population and the GDP values of each country can affect on the number of the medals which were won for that country. Leaner regression and polynomial regression were implemented and able to predict the medal tally of a country with an error (RMSE) of 28 medals by using linear regression and with an error (RMSE) of 27 medals when using polynomial regression on – GDP and Population.
